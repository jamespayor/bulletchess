Performance Comparisons
========================

``bulletchess``'s creation was motivated by frustration with `python-chess <https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_'s slow performance.
``python-chess`` is a fantastic, feature-rich library, but is inherently limited in its performance by being implemented by python. ``bulletchess``, however, is implemented as a pure C-extension.
To demonstrate how much faster ``bulletchess`` is, we can write equivalent functions in both libraries, and compare the runtimes.


Let's start by implementing a `Perft <https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft>`_ function. In ``bulletchess``:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 13-30

.. code-block:: Python

    import bulletchess
    from bulletchess.utils import count_moves

    def bullet_perft(board : bulletchess.Board, depth : int) -> int:
        if depth == 0:
            return 1
        elif depth == 1:
            return count_moves(board)
        else:
            nodes = 0
            moves = board.legal_moves()
            for move in moves:
                board.apply(move)
                nodes += bullet_perft(board, depth - 1)
                board.undo()
            return nodes 








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-32

And in ``python-chess``

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-47

.. code-block:: Python


    import chess
    def chess_perft(board : chess.Board, depth : int) -> int:
        if depth == 0:
            return 1
        elif depth == 1:
            return board.legal_moves.count()
        else:
            nodes = 0
            for move in board.legal_moves:
                board.push(move)
                nodes += chess_perft(board, depth - 1)
                board.pop()
            return nodes
    







.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-49

Notice how the code we write is nearly identical. However, when we test their run times:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-65

.. code-block:: Python



    from time import time

    start = time()
    result = chess_perft(chess.Board(), 6)
    chess_time = time() - start
    print(f"`chess_perft` returned {result} in {chess_time:.4f}s")

    start = time()
    bullet_perft(bulletchess.Board(), 6)
    bullet_time = time() - start
    print(f"`bullet_perft` returned {result} in {bullet_time:.4f}s")

    print(f"bulletchess is {chess_time/bullet_time:.4f}x faster")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    `chess_perft` returned 119060324 in 111.1050s
    `bullet_perft` returned 119060324 in 1.7389s
    bulletchess is 63.8936x faster




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-68

We see a massive difference in ``bulletchess``'s move generation and application speed. 
``bulletchess`` is also very fast at writing and parsing FEN strings. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-74

.. code-block:: Python


    import json
    # JSON file with a list of 1 million FENs
    with open("../data/fens.json", "r") as f:
        fens = json.load(f)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 75-80

We can define FEN "roundtrip" functions in ``bulletchess`` and ``python-chess``, which will take in a list of FEN strings.
Each FEN will be parsed to create a object representation for the position it describes.
Then, each object will write a new FEN string describing itself, which should match the original.
Neither library stores the given FEN when a board object is created,
so both ``bulletchess`` and ``python-chess`` will fully parse and rewrite the input FENs.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 80-92

.. code-block:: Python



    def bullet_roundtrip(fens : list[str]):
        boards = [bulletchess.Board.from_fen(fen)
                  for fen in fens]
        return [board.fen() for board in boards]


    def chess_roundtrip(fens : list[str]):
        boards = [chess.Board(fen) for fen in fens]
        return [board.fen(en_passant = "fen") for board in boards]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 93-94

Like before, we'll compare the runtimes of each version.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 94-109

.. code-block:: Python


    start = time()
    chess_fens = chess_roundtrip(fens)
    chess_time = time() - start
    print(f"`chess_roundtrip` took {chess_time:.4}")

    start = time()
    bullet_fens = bullet_roundtrip(fens)
    bullet_time = time() - start
    print(f"`bullet_roundtrip` took {bullet_time:.4}")

    print(f"bulletchess is {chess_time/bullet_time:.4f}x faster")

    assert(chess_fens == bullet_fens)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    `chess_roundtrip` took 47.3
    `bullet_roundtrip` took 0.9728
    bulletchess is 48.6200x faster




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-112

Once again, ``bulletchess`` is much faster. Using the same dataset of FENs, lets compare checking if positions
are checkmate, a draw, or ongoing. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 112-139

.. code-block:: Python



    def chess_statuses(boards : list[chess.Board]) -> dict:
        outcomes = {"ongoing": 0, "checkmate": 0, "draw": 0}
        for board in boards:
            outcome = board.outcome(claim_draw = True)
            if outcome == None:
                outcomes["ongoing"] += 1
            elif outcome.winner != None:
                outcomes["checkmate"] += 1
            else:
                outcomes["draw"] += 1
        return outcomes


    from bulletchess import CHECKMATE, DRAW
    def bullet_statuses(boards : list[bulletchess.Board]) -> dict:
        outcomes = {"ongoing": 0, "checkmate": 0, "draw": 0}
        for board in boards:
            if board in CHECKMATE:
                outcomes["checkmate"] += 1
            elif board in DRAW:
                outcomes["draw"] += 1
            else:
                outcomes["ongoing"] += 1
        return outcomes








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 140-142

The syntax of ``bulletchess`` and ``python-chess`` diverges more here,
but the structure is still the same. Running the comparison:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 142-160

.. code-block:: Python


    chess_boards = [chess.Board(fen) for fen in fens]
    bullet_boards = [bulletchess.Board.from_fen(fen) for fen in fens]

    start = time()
    chess_res = chess_statuses(chess_boards)
    chess_time = time() - start
    print(f"`chess_statuses` took {chess_time:.4}")
    print(chess_res)

    start = time()
    bullet_res = bullet_statuses(bullet_boards)
    bullet_time = time() - start
    print(f"`bullet_statuses` took {bullet_time:.4}")
    print(bullet_res)

    print(f"bulletchess is {chess_time/bullet_time:.4f}x faster")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    `chess_statuses` took 114.3
    {'ongoing': 933861, 'checkmate': 40147, 'draw': 25992}
    `bullet_statuses` took 0.3081
    {'ongoing': 933861, 'checkmate': 40147, 'draw': 25992}
    bulletchess is 371.0375x faster




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 161-163

The speed up is even larger. Like ``python-chess``, ``bulletchess`` provides a PGN reader. Let's do a simple task reading a PGN file,
we'll go through every position in each game, and check how many have a pawn of any color on E4. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 163-198

.. code-block:: Python


    # a large PGN file

    import chess.pgn
    import bulletchess.pgn
    PATH = "../data/pgn/modern.pgn"

    def chess_check_games():
        count = 0
        with open(PATH, "r") as f:
            game = chess.pgn.read_game(f)
            while game:
                board = chess.Board()
                for move in game.mainline_moves():
                    board.push(move)
                    if board.piece_type_at(chess.E4) == chess.PAWN:
                        count += 1
                game = chess.pgn.read_game(f)
        return count

    def bullet_check_games():
        count = 0
        with bulletchess.pgn.PGNFile.open(PATH) as f:
            game = f.next_game()
            while game:
                board = game.starting_board
                for move in game.moves:
                    board.apply(move)
                    piece = board[bulletchess.E4]
                    if piece and piece.piece_type == bulletchess.PAWN:
                        count += 1
                game = f.next_game()
        return count

We've kept the operation on each position simple on purpose, so we can more directly compare 
reading through games.
