    A simple heuristic function for the utility of a Board

    This implementation differs in using centipawns instead of fractional values,

    The number of Kings is reconsidered as whether or not a player is in Checkmate.

    (1) K,Q,R,B,B,P are the number of White kings, queens, rooks, bishops, knights

    White).
